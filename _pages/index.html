Welcome to the Spruced Up Thrift Shop. We are privileged to be serving the
people of the Skagit Valley and surrounding areas. It is our desire to help
meet the needs of the communities in our valley by selling donated clothing and
other household items at affordable prices and at the same time generating
funds to support community service projects.
