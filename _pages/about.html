<b>The Beginning:</b>
<blockquote>
The Women's Ministries Division of the North Cascade Seventh-day Adventist
Church (NCSDA) desired to help meet the needs of the people living in the
Skagit Valley by raising funds for community service projects. They decided the
best way to accomplish this goal was with the two-fold ministry of a thrift
shop.  A thrift shop would provide access to quality used clothes and other
household items at affordable prices and at the same time generate funds that
could then be given to community organizations specializing in meeting the
needs of the local residents as well as projects reaching beyond the Skagit
Valley.
<br /><br />
The Women's Ministries Team shared their vision of opening a thrift shop with
the NCSDA church board in September 1996.  The church board embraced the vision
and in October 1996, the Spruced Up Thrift Shop opened its doors on Spruce
Street in downtown Burlington, Washington.
</blockquote>

<b>Expansion:</b>
<blockquote>
The store thrived under the management of these women and the overwhelming
support of the church and community. Soon the space on Spruce Street was filled
to overflowing and the possibility of relocating was considered.  When a larger
commercial space on Fairhaven Avenue became available, it was decided to move
the thrift shop just around the corner from Spruce Street to Fairhaven Avenue,
thus allowing the thrift shop to expand and bring in more donations and
profits.
<br /><br />
Other changes also took place and the thrift shop was no longer run solely by
the Women's Ministries Division, but became its own entity, welcoming the added
help from  additional women, men, and youth.
<br /><br />
Thanks to the support and generosity of the church and community, the Spruced
Up Thrift Shop continues to serve the residents of the Skagit Valley and
beyond. In order to meet a growing need for a local supplier of vegetarian
products, the Spruced Up Thrift Shop now carries a variety of canned and frozen
vegetarian products.
</blockquote>

<b>The Future:</b>
<blockquote>
We are thankful for the opportunity to continue fulfilling our mission of
reaching out to all the poeple of the Skagit Valley and surrounding areas and
are always looking for new ways to meet the needs of our community. We hope you
will stop by soon and see our ever growing and always changing inventory.
