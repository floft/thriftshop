We thank the many volunteers who donate hundreds of hours each month to keep
the shop open and running smoothly, but there is always a need for more help.
Help is especially needed in these areas:<br />

<blockquote>
 - Merchandise preparation <br />
 - Inventory organization<br />
 - Cashier and Customer Service <br />
</blockquote><br /><br />

shop or stop by the store during regular store hours.
