Thank you to everyone who has donated goods to our thrift store.  Without your
donations, we would not be able to generate any profits and give to the many
different service projects in our community.
<br /><br />
We are always in need of donated clothing, household goods, and other items to
sell. Donations may be dropped off at our store during regular store hours.
<br /><br />
Please call if you need to make other arrangements:
<blockquote> (360) 755-1141<br /></blockquote>
There is also a large donation box located inside the North Cascade Seventh-day
Adventist Church. Below is the address of the church:<br />
